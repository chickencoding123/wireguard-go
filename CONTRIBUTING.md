## Issue Reporting Guidelines

1. If you're experiencing an issue, then first search for answers:
  - In upstream repository under issues open or closed
  - In this repository under issues open or closed
  - On the web
2. Make sure the issue is in fact related to this repository, otherwise, open an issue in upstream repository

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `master`, and merge back to that branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will allow you to squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. A demo is preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage, if applicable.

## Development Setup

You will need go >= 1.23.4 installed.
